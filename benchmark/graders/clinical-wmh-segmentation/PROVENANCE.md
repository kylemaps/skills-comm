# Provenance — how this grader pack was built

Frozen reference for **WMH Segmentation Challenge 2017, Amsterdam/GE3T/100** (clinical FLAIR, native
FLAIR space). White-matter hyperintensities of presumed vascular origin (dementia / small-vessel axis).

## Ground truth

`lesion_mask.nii.gz` is the **primary expert WMH mask** (observers O1/O2 per the challenge's reference
standard [1], STRIVE-compliant), binarised to WMH (label 1; the dataset's label 2 "other pathology" is not
present for this subject). Native FLAIR space, 6.27 cm³, **115 foci**.

## Thresholds are data-derived from inter-rater agreement

The WMH Challenge [1] ships two additional raters (O3, O4) on the training subjects. Scoring each
against the primary gives a *measured* envelope rather than a literature guess:

| rater vs primary | Dice | lesion-wise F1 | volume error |
|---|---|---|---|
| O3 | 0.774 | 0.794 | 13 % |
| O4 | 0.792 | 0.876 | 4 % |

Envelope: **full marks = mean rater-vs-primary** (as good as another expert), **pass = a margin below
the worst rater**:

| metric | full | pass |
|---|---|---|
| Dice | 0.783 | 0.574 |
| lesion-wise F1 | 0.835 | 0.544 |
| abs. volume error | 9 % | 48.6 % |

Weights: Dice 0.40, lesion-wise F1 0.40, volume error 0.20 — F1 raised to parity with Dice because WMH
are many small foci where detection, not just boundary overlap, is the point.

## Validation

Against the pack: primary self → `indistinguishable` (q100); **O4 → `indistinguishable`** and **O3 →
`acceptable` (q90)** — the two real raters land at "as good as another expert"; dilate the mask by 2
voxels → `marginal` (Dice 0.24, +636 % volume — tiny lesions are unforgiving); erode by 1 →
`unacceptable`; empty → `invalid`.

## Data access (open, agent-runnable)

Images: DataverseNL DOI `10.34894/AECRSD`, open Dataverse access API (`curl .../api/access/datafile/<id>`,
no auth/DUA). FLAIR file id 325669, T1 id 325515 for this subject. The expert masks (primary id 325503,
O3 326449, O4 326442) are used to build this pack and live on OSF — never given to the agent.

## Caveats

- **FLAIR is anisotropic** (~1.2 × 1.0 × 3.0 mm, 2D multi-slice) — realistic clinical WMH data.
- **Two extra raters, not a full distribution** — the envelope uses O3/O4 vs primary; more raters
  would tighten it.
- License CC-BY-NC-4.0 (non-commercial), fine for a benchmark.

## References

Thresholds here are **data-derived** (O3/O4 vs primary), not a literature prior — this reference is
*dataset / protocol provenance*, crediting the source of the reference standard and the multi-observer
masks the envelope is built on.
